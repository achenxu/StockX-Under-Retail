# StockX-Under-Retail
Finds sneaker asks at or under retails price on StockX.

When ran the user will enter what they are looking for. This can be a keyword or the sneaker SKU. Once entered the program will display all asks at or under retail or let you know if there are not asks under retail.

This does not work with anything besides sneakers at the moment.
